## Monolith Architecture

Monolith architecture is a traditional model for designing software applications. In this architecture, all components of the application are interconnected and interdependent, forming a single, unified codebase.

### Example
Consider an e-commerce application where the user interface, business logic, and data access layers are all part of a single codebase. Any change in one part of the application requires redeploying the entire application.

## Microservices Architecture

Microservices architecture is a design pattern where an application is composed of small, independent services that communicate over well-defined APIs. Each service is focused on a specific business function and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

### Example
Consider the same e-commerce application, but now the user interface, product catalog, order management, and payment processing are separate services. Each service can be updated and deployed without affecting the others.
